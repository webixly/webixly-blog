## 🔢 What Is a Number System?

A **number system** is a way to represent numbers using a specific set of symbols and a base value.

Each number system is defined by:
- **Digits (symbols)** it uses.
- **Base (or radix)** — how many unique digits it contains.

## 🌍 Common Number Systems

| System | Base | Digits Used | Example | Common Usage |
|:-------|:----:|:-------------|:----------|:-------------|
| **Binary** | 2 | 0, 1 | 1011 | Internal computer operations |
| **Octal** | 8 | 0–7 | 17 | Older computing systems |
| **Decimal** | 10 | 0–9 | 245 | Everyday human usage |
| **Hexadecimal** | 16 | 0–9, A–F | 3A | Memory addresses, colors, and low-level code |

## ⚙️ Why Computers Use Binary

Computers are built from electrical circuits that have **two states**:
- **ON (1)**  
- **OFF (0)**  

This makes the **binary system (base 2)** perfect for representing information electronically.

---

## 💡 Exponents and Bases

An **exponent** shows how many times a number (the base) is multiplied by itself.

**Example:**
- \( 2^3 = 2 × 2 × 2 = 8 \)
- \( 10^2 = 100 \)
- \( 16^1 = 16 \)

Each number system can be expressed using exponents of its base.

### Example in Binary:
`1011₂ = 1×2³ + 0×2² + 1×2¹ + 1×2⁰ = 11₁₀`

## 🧠 Understanding Base Values

| Base | Power of 2 | Meaning |
|:------|:-----------:|:-------------|
| 2⁰ | 1 | Least significant bit |
| 2¹ | 2 | Represents 2 |
| 2² | 4 | Represents 4 |
| 2³ | 8 | Represents 8 |

The pattern continues — every new bit doubles the possible range of values.

## 🧭 Summary

- A **base** defines how many unique digits a system uses.  
- Computers use **binary (base 2)** because of their electronic nature.  
- Exponents help describe how numbers grow and how data is represented.  
- Understanding these basics is essential before moving to topics like **data representation** or **memory addressing**.
