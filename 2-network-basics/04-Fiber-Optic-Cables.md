# 💡 Fiber Optic Cables

## ⚙️ What Are Fiber Optic Cables?
**Fiber optic cables** use **light** instead of electrical signals to transmit data.  
They consist of **thin strands of glass or plastic fibers** that carry information using light pulses generated by lasers or LEDs.

This allows **much higher speeds, longer distances, and better resistance to interference** than copper cables.

## 🔬 Structure of a Fiber Optic Cable

A typical fiber optic cable has these main components:

1. **Core** – The glass or plastic center that carries the light signal.  
2. **Cladding** – Reflects light back into the core, keeping it inside.  
3. **Buffer coating** – Protects the fiber from physical damage.  
4. **Outer jacket** – Adds strength and protection from the environment.

🧠 Light travels through the core by a process called **Total Internal Reflection**.

## 🧩 Types of Fiber Optic Cables

| Type | Name | Core Size | Light Source | Speed | Distance | Typical Use |
|------|------|------------|---------------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| **SMF** | Single-Mode Fiber | 8–10 µm | Laser | Up to 100 Gbps+ | Up to 100 km+ | Long-distance links, ISPs |
| **MMF** | Multi-Mode Fiber | 50–62.5 µm | LED | Up to 10 Gbps | Up to 550 m | LANs, data centers |

## Modes of Transmission

### **1. Single-Mode Fiber (SMF)**
- Allows **only one light path** to travel.  
- Offers **very high bandwidth** and minimal signal loss.  
- Used for **long-distance communication** (like undersea cables or WANs).

### **2. Multi-Mode Fiber (MMF)**
- Allows **multiple light paths** (modes) at once.  
- More affordable but suffers from **modal dispersion** (signal distortion).  
- Ideal for **short-range, high-speed networks** (offices, data centers).

## ⚡ Connectors & Standards

| Connector | Description | Common Use |
|------------|--------------|-------------|
| **ST** | Straight Tip | Older installations |
| **SC** | Subscriber Connector | Easy to plug/unplug |
| **LC** | Lucent Connector | Compact, common in modern equipment |
| **MTP/MPO** | Multi-fiber connector | High-density data centers |

Common Ethernet fiber standards:
- **100Base-FX** (Fast Ethernet)
- **1000Base-LX/SX** (Gigabit Ethernet)
- **10GBase-LR/SR** (10 Gigabit Ethernet)

## 🧯 Advantages & Disadvantages

### ✅ Advantages:
- Extremely **high bandwidth** (Tbps possible)
- **Long-distance** data transmission
- Immune to **electromagnetic interference (EMI)**
- Enhanced **security** — difficult to tap

### ❌ Disadvantages:
- More **expensive** than copper
- **Fragile** (glass fibers can break easily)
- Requires **special tools** for splicing and installation

## 🌐 Common Applications
- Internet backbone and ISPs  
- Data centers and cloud providers  
- Military and government communication networks  
- FTTH (Fiber To The Home) connections  
- Long-haul undersea cables

## 🔒 Fiber Optics & Cybersecurity
Fiber optics play a critical role in secure networking:
- Harder to **tap or intercept** signals compared to copper.  
- Used in **high-security environments** (banks, defense, telecom).  
- Enables **high-speed encrypted data transmission**.
