# What is a Computer?

**Level:** Beginner  
**Category:** Computer Fundamentals

A computer is an electronic device that receives, processes, stores, and outputs information.  
It operates by executing instructions (software) on physical components (hardware).

## 🧩 Overview

A computer system consists of two main parts:

- **Hardware** — the physical components: CPU, RAM, storage (HDD/SSD), motherboard, GPU, input/output devices (keyboard, mouse, monitor).
- **Software** — programs and operating systems that tell the hardware what to do. Examples: Windows, Linux, applications, and scripts.

Computers work with **binary data** (0s and 1s). The CPU executes instructions, memory holds data temporarily, and storage keeps data persistently.

## ⚙️ Key Components

### CPU (Central Processing Unit)
- The "brain" of the computer; executes instructions from programs.
- Measured by cores and clock speed (GHz).

### RAM (Random Access Memory)
- Volatile memory used to store data and instructions while programs run.
- More RAM → better multitasking.

### Storage
- Persistent storage: HDD (spinning disk) or SSD (flash-based).
- Stores OS, applications, and user data.

### Motherboard & Buses
- Connects all components and provides communication channels (buses).

### Input/Output Devices
- Keyboard, mouse, monitor, network interface, etc.

## 🔁 How Data Flows (Simple)

1. Power on → BIOS/UEFI runs → Bootloader loads the operating system.  
2. OS initializes drivers and services.  
3. Programs load into RAM; CPU executes instructions; results may be written to disk or shown on screen.

## 🧪 Example: Simple Command (Linux)

Open a terminal and run:
```bash
uname -a        # show kernel and system information
top             # real-time process monitor
df -h           # disk usage human-readable
