# 🧠 Copper Cables (Ethernet)

## ⚙️ What Are Copper Cables?
Copper cables are the most common type of physical media used in Ethernet networks.  
They use **copper wires** to transmit data using **electrical signals** (not light, like fiber optic cables).

## 🧩 Types of Copper Ethernet Cables

| Type | Name | Max Speed | Max Distance | Shielding | Typical Use |
|------|------|------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Cat5** | Category 5 | 100 Mbps | 100 m | UTP | Old networks |
| **Cat5e** | Enhanced Cat5 | 1 Gbps | 100 m | UTP | Home/small networks |
| **Cat6** | Category 6 | 10 Gbps | 55 m | UTP/STP | Modern LANs |
| **Cat6a** | Augmented Cat6 | 10 Gbps | 100 m | STP | Data centers |
| **Cat7** | Category 7 | 10+ Gbps | 100 m | S/FTP | High-end networking |
| **Cat8** | Category 8 | 25–40 Gbps | 30 m | Shielded | Servers & data centers |

## 🔌 Structure of Ethernet Copper Cable
A typical Ethernet cable contains **4 twisted pairs** of copper wires:

- Each pair carries **differential signals** to reduce interference.
- The twisting helps minimize **crosstalk** between pairs.

🧵 **Example:**
- Orange pair → Transmit data  
- Green pair → Receive data  
- Blue & Brown pairs → Often used for power (PoE) or additional signals

## ⚡ Shielding Types

| Type | Meaning | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **UTP** | Unshielded Twisted Pair | No shielding, cheaper, flexible |
| **STP** | Shielded Twisted Pair | Foil/braid around pairs for protection |
| **FTP** | Foiled Twisted Pair | Overall foil shield for all pairs |
| **S/FTP** | Shielded + Foiled Twisted Pair | Highest protection, used in Cat7+ |

## 🧯 Advantages & Disadvantages

### ✅ Advantages:
- Low cost and easy to install  
- Supports **Power over Ethernet (PoE)**  
- Flexible and reliable for short distances  

### ❌ Disadvantages:
- Sensitive to **electromagnetic interference (EMI)**  
- Limited to ~100 meters for most categories  
- Lower bandwidth than fiber optics
